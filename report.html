<h1>AI-Assisted Website Security Surface Scan</h1>

<h2>Surface Security Indicators</h2>
<table id="indicatorTable">
<tr><th>Indicator</th><th>Status</th></tr>

<h2>Plain English Summary</h2>
<pre id="summary"></pre>

<h2>Observed Risk Implications</h2>

<p><strong>HTTPS Transport</strong><br>
Where HTTPS is present and correctly enforced, data exchanged between users
and the website benefits from encryption in transit. This reduces exposure
to interception, manipulation, or passive monitoring of network traffic.
</p>

<p><strong>HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)</strong><br>
Where HSTS is not observed, browsers may permit fallback to unencrypted
connections under certain conditions. This increases exposure to downgrade
and interception scenarios on hostile or misconfigured networks.
</p>

<p><strong>Content Security Policy (CSP)</strong><br>
The absence of a CSP limits a site’s ability to explicitly control trusted
content sources. This increases susceptibility to script injection,
unexpected third-party execution, and supply-chain driven compromise.
</p>

<p><strong>Clickjacking Protection</strong><br>
Weak or missing clickjacking controls may allow a site to be embedded within
external frames. In some scenarios, this can be leveraged to manipulate user
actions without clear visibility or intent.
</p>

<p><strong>MIME Sniffing Protection</strong><br>
Without explicit MIME handling controls, browsers may reinterpret content
types. This increases the risk of unintended script execution when content
is misclassified or manipulated.
</p>

<p><strong>Referrer Policy</strong><br>
An undefined referrer policy may result in internal URLs or contextual data
being shared externally during navigation, increasing unintended information
exposure.
</p>

<p><strong>Permissions Policy</strong><br>
Where no permissions policy is observed, browser feature access defaults to
broader allowances. This increases reliance on browser behaviour rather than
explicit limitation of sensitive capabilities.
</p>

<h2>Assessment Integrity & Disclosure</h2>
<p>
This report is based on automated analysis of publicly observable website
behaviour at the time of assessment. It evaluates surface-level configuration
indicators only and does not perform penetration testing, exploit
development, vulnerability scanning, or active probing.
</p>
<p>
Findings do not confirm exploitability, unauthorised access, compromise, or
breach. Results are time-specific and may change as configurations,
infrastructure, or third-party services are updated.
</p>

<h2>Professional Recommendation & Engagement Position</h2>
<p>
The risks identified in this assessment relate to modern browser behaviour,
client-side execution controls, and evolving attack techniques that require
specialist knowledge to address correctly and sustainably.
</p>
<p>
Urban Sentinel is specifically structured to design, implement, and validate
AI-driven security uplift across web platforms, ensuring changes align with
current threat intelligence, platform behaviour, and regulatory
expectations.
</p>
<p>
While clients remain free to engage alternative providers, remediation of
the identified risks is strongly recommended to be undertaken by a
specialised capability with demonstrated expertise in AI-assisted security
assessment and implementation.
</p>

<h2>Government Grant & Advisory Pathways</h2>
<p>
This report may be used as supporting evidence for government-funded digital
uplift, cyber resilience, or modernisation programs. Where funding is
obtained, implementation is expected to be delivered by a suitably capable
provider aligned with the scope and complexity of the identified risks.
